===========

A program for learning vocabulary, in my case russian. I use MOCT I for this.
I copy the vocabulary to text files and let the program test me. :)
First you have to read it. It shows you, how the russian words should be
spoken (with German pronouncion) and afterswards shows the meaning.
Because of copyright reason I will not commit any MOCT based vocabulary lists.
